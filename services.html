          <p>
            As a private therapy practice I offer counselling and therapy to
            individuals, couples and families, including families with grown-up
            children. I am fully registered with the Association for Family
            Therapy (AFT) and United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), a
            leading UK professional body. I have over 10 years experience in the
            NHS and in private practice. I am able to offer you a thoughtful,
            engaged, helpful counselling and psychotherapy service both
            in-person (face to face) and online. My practice is built upon the
            most widely recognised and respected therapeutic approaches for a
            wide range of issues and concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever your age, race, colour, nationality, religious or political
            belief or sexual orientation, disability, gender identity I value
            the opportunity to work with you.
          </p>

          <div class="page-title">About psychotherapy and counselling</div>

          <p>
            In practice there is little difference between psychotherapy and
            counselling. Both can help with a wide range of concerns, no matter
            how long you have been struggling with them. What is different is
            the level of training – training to be a counsellor takes less time
            than training to be a psychotherapist. I’m a psychotherapist. But I
            use the term counsellor because it’s the one that most people use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The perspective we bring to the work is based upon our clinical
            experience, knowledge of theoretical approaches and experience of
            our sessions.
          </p>

          <div class="page-title">
            What to expect from my counselling service
          </div>
          <p>
            Counselling is often a term used to describe shorter term therapy,
            often in response to an event where psychological distress has been
            experienced over a relatively short period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sessions involve us meeting, talking and listening together with
            the mutual purpose of paying careful attention to your concerns and
            gaining a greater understanding of your own particular situation. It
            is a shared process and the therapeutic relationship can only be
            nurtured in a safe and dependable environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work carefully and respectfully, honouring your privacy, autonomy
            and independence and your freedom and ability to make choices for
            yourself. Within the therapeutic relationship you can explore your
            physical and emotional feelings, your thoughts and behaviours and
            the contexts in which they arise.

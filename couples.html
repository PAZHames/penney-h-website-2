            Couple counselling and therapy can be a positive experience at any
            stage of a relationship. As relationships progress new challenges
            and possibilities arise where counselling and therapy can facilitate
            growth, change and alleviate conflict. Very often, couple
            counselling and therapy is helpful when one or both of you are
            feeling misunderstood or isolated, or when you identify negative and
            destructive patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> What to expect in couples counselling </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            As a couple counsellor in Alton I provide a warm, supportive and
            non-judgmental environment, and I do not take sides. I do not come
            to the sessions with an agenda; I are not here to tell you what to
            do or to manipulate you into staying together. I am here to
            facilitate you in finding your own way forward; for some partners
            this will mean finding a more creative and positive future for the
            relationship, while for others it may mean helping you to accept and
            manage the end of a relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we meet I will listen carefully and respectfully, to both of
            you. I will honour your privacy, autonomy and independence and help
            you to identify the unhelpful patterns of interaction that have
            grown up between you.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Clients come with a variety of concerns including breakdowns in
            communication, parenting, fertility, sexual relations, infidelity,
            financial pressures, loss or bereavements, work issues, transitions
            including preparing for marriage or managing a break up, cultural
            differences and age differential. I have experience of working with
            couples with children, couples from mixed cultural backgrounds and
            couples from early twenties through to sixties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether your relationship is relatively new or well established
            couples can have problems, I have extensive knowledge and expertise
            to help resolve any issues that you may be having.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am experienced at working with couples and relationships both
            in-person and online so you can be certain I know how to ensure your
            sessions deliver the outcomes you want.
          </p>
          <p><strong>What approaches do I use? </strong></p>
          <p>
            I start from the idea that we are wired to be social. What one of
            you does effects the other and vice versa. I completely understand
            that it’s hard to see your own side of the pattern from the middle
            of the relationship
          </p>
          <p>
            I will draw on one of the best validated, most successful and well
            known approaches to healing distressed couple relationships:
            Emotionally Focussed Therapy. We’ll start from where you are –
            getting a clear picture of just what happens when you argue or when
            things don’t feel right. We’ll focus in on the patterns you get
            into, and explore what triggers each of you to react in the ways
            that you do. I’ll help you make sense of why it’s so painful by
            helping you to go inside to explore what goes on for both of you in
            those moments when you feel emotionally disconnected. A threat to
            your relationship can pitch both of you into and your partner..
          </p>
          <p>
            I can help you identify and understand the negative pattern you’re
            in, tune intosafely and effectively express your needs, and
            ultimately discover new ways to reinforce and strengthen the kind of
            secure emotional bond we all long for. Research has shown that 85%
            of couples who stay the course experience deeper, more connected
            relationships. And what is more, these relationships last.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is being used with many different kinds of couples and
            many different cultural groups. It is practiced around the world and
            is recognised as an effective evidence-based couple, individual and
            family therapy approach. This approach can give us what we all want:
            close, deep, trusting relationships with those who matter most.

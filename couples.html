            Couple counselling can be a positive experience at any stage of a
            relationship. As relationships progress new challenges and
            possibilities arise where therapy can facilitate growth, change and
            alleviate conflict. Very often, couple counselling is helpful when
            one or both of you are feeling misunderstood or isolated, or when
            you identify negative and destructive patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> What to expect in couples counselling </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            As a couple counsellor in Alton I provide a warm, supportive and
            non-judgmental environment, and I do not take sides. I do not come
            to the sessions with an agenda. I am here to facilitate you in
            finding your own way forward; for some partners this will mean
            finding a more creative and positive future for the relationship,
            while for others it may mean helping you to accept and manage the
            end of a relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we meet I will listen carefully and respectfully, to both of
            you. I will honour your privacy, autonomy and independence and help
            you to identify the unhelpful patterns of interaction that have
            grown up between you.
          </p>

            <strong>Who comes for couple counselling in Alton? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients come with a variety of concerns including breakdowns in
            communication, parenting, fertility, sexual relations, infidelity,
            financial pressures, loss or bereavements, work issues, transitions
            including preparing for marriage or managing a break up, cultural
            differences and age differential. I have experience of working with
            couples with children, couples from mixed cultural backgrounds and
            couples from early twenties through to sixties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether your relationship is relatively new or well established
            couples can have problems, I have extensive knowledge and expertise
            to help resolve any issues that you may be having.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am experienced at working with couples and relationships both
            in-person and online so you can be certain I know how to ensure your
            sessions deliver the outcomes you want.
          </p>
          <p><strong>What approaches do I use? </strong></p>
          <p>
            I start from the idea that we are wired to be social. What one of
            you does effects the other and vice versa. I completely understand
            that it’s hard to see your own side of the pattern from the middle
            of the relationship
          </p>
          <p>
            I will draw on one of the best validated, most successful and well
            known approaches to healing distressed couple relationships:
            Emotionally Focussed Therapy. We’ll start from where you are –
            getting a clear picture of just what happens when you argue or when
            things don’t feel right. We’ll focus in on the patterns you get
            into, and explore what triggers each of you to react in the ways
            that you do. I’ll help you make sense of why it’s so painful by
            helping you to go inside to explore what goes on for both of you in
            those moments when you feel emotionally disconnected. A threat to
            your relationship can pitch both of you into very different
            repsonses that pull you further apart rather than closer together.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can help you identify and understand the negative pattern you’re
            in, tune into what's going on inside you, safely and effectively,
            ??? express your needs, and ultimately discover new ways to
            reinforce and strengthen the kind of secure emotional bond we all
            long for. Research has shown that 85% of couples who stay the course
            experience deeper, more connected relationships. And what is more,
            these relationships last.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is being used with many different kinds of couples and
            many different cultural groups. It is practiced around the world and
            is recognised as an effective evidence-based couple, individual and
            family therapy approach. This approach can give us what we all want:
            close, deep, trusting relationships with those who matter most.

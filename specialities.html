              <p>
                We all struggle at times. Often the struggle is with something
                which has been around for an extended period of time or feels as
                though it has arisen at various times throughout life. At other
                times it is something completely new that disturbs our present
                life. Counselling is relevant where there is a sense of
                struggle. Counselling is a type of talking therapy that can be
                used to treat emotional and psychological concerns.
              </p>
              <p>
                I offer both in-person and online counselling. Each session
                involves us meeting, talking and listening together with the aim
                of paying careful attention to your concerns and gaining a
                greater understanding of your own particular situation. It is a
                shared process of trust. A therapeutic relationship can only be
                nurtured in a safe and dependable environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I work carefully and respectfully, honouring your privacy,
                autonomy and independence and your freedom and ability to make
                choices for yourself. Within the therapeutic relationship you
                can explore your physical and emotional feelings, your thoughts
                and behaviours and the contexts in which they arise.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am experienced in speaking with people about a wide range of
                concerns brought to private counselling. The perspectives I
                offer are based on my clinical experience, my knowledge of
                theoretical approaches and what I experience works for you as an
                individual.
              </p>
              <div class="page-title"><small>And Couples</small></div>
              <p>
                Couple counselling and therapy can be a positive experience at
                any stage of a relationship. As relationships progress new
                challenges and possibilities arise where counselling and therapy
                can facilitate growth, change and alleviate conflict. Very
                often, couple counselling and therapy is helpful when one or
                both of you are feeling misunderstood or isolated, or when you
                identify negative and destructive patterns.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> What to expect in couples counselling </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                As a couple counsellor in Alton I provide a warm, supportive and
                non-judgmental environment, and I do not take sides. I do not
                come to the sessions with an agenda; I are not here to tell you
                what to do or to manipulate you into staying together. I am here
                to facilitate you in finding your own way forward; for some
                partners this will mean finding a more creative and positive
                future for the relationship, while for others it may mean
                helping you to accept and manage the end of a relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we meet I will listen carefully and respectfully, to both
                of you. I will honour your privacy, autonomy and independence
                and help you to identify the unhelpful patterns of interaction
                that have grown up between you.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  Who comes for couple counselling and therapy in Alton?
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Clients come with a variety of concerns including breakdowns in
                communication, parenting, fertility, sexual relations,
                infidelity, financial pressures, loss or bereavements, work
                issues, transitions including preparing for marriage or managing
                a break up, cultural differences and age differential. I have
                experience of working with couples with children, couples from
                mixed cultural backgrounds and couples from early twenties
                through to sixties.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether your relationship is relatively new or well established
                couples can have problems, I have extensive knowledge and
                expertise to help resolve any issues that you may be having.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am experienced at working with couples and relationships both
                in-person and online so you can be certain I know how to ensure
                your sessions deliver the outcomes you want.
              </p>
              <div class="page-title">Specialities</div>
              <p>
                Whilst all talking therapies use the same core skills and
                expertise, I understand you might want your therapist to be
                familiar with the concern you want to bring and so the listed
                specialities are concerns that I have experience working with.
                Whatever age, sex, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality or
                sexuality, I have the relevant experience and skills to meet
                your needs.
              </p>
              <p>I have over ten years clinical experience, during which I have talked with hundreds of people facing many dilemmas and struggles.  However you might be wondering about specific concerns I have experience in working with so please review my specialities below. </p>
